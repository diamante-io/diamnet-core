## Read before creating an issue

In general, we close any issues that are
* unactionable (fill the template below under "Description")
* questions best served elsewhere

We have a small community of people that manages issues, and we want to ensure that the issues that remain open are high quality (so we actually get around to implementing them!).

### I have a question!

The diamnet-core issues repository is meant for reporting bugs and feature requests related to diamnet-core's implementation.

If you have a question, we would recommend that you take a look at Diamnet's [developer portal][1], where you'll find comprehensive documentation related to Diamnet.

If you can't find an answer to your question you can:
* submit a question to [Diamnet's Stack Exchange][2].
* or ask one of [Diamnet's communities][3].

### I'm fairly certain it's a bug.

* Please check existing and closed issues in Github! You may have to remove the `is:open` filter.
* Check the [releases](https://github.com/diamnet/diamnet-core/releases) page to see if your issue has been fixed in a later release.
* When possible, re-open an old issue if there's been a regression. Be sure to include additional
  details on what was supposed to be working.
